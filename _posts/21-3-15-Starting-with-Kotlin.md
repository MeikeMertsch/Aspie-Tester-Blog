Just like the developers in our project, we looked recently into the possibility of combining Java and Kotlin, if not, over time, maybe completely to switch over to Kotlin. 

In the past ten or so years, I have learned a good bunch of different languages, so I knew I had a chance that Kotlin would come easy to me. And of course Java and Kotlin work so well together because they are quite similar in many senses. Still, I thought I would quickly write down how I approached this new language and how I went about learning it. Here are the sources I used that helped me get up to speed fast and easy:

# Ready...

The first thing that I came across was a video:

[![Kolin in three hours Youtube video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/F9UC9DY-vIU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9UC9DY-vIU&amp;t=5191s)

This was extremely useful. It explains how to get a project set up in IntelliJ and then plays with the things you can do with the language with fairly simple examples. After less than an hour I was able to solve simpler problems in Kotlin.

# Steady...

The second thing that I worked with to explore several topics a little more and still use the same way I would use a lexicon, is [the Baeldung website](https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin-overview). It is a website that I know from trying to figure things out in Java and I was happy to see they also have an area for Kotlin. Even though this website doesn't technically count as a course, you can work through the different parts almost as if they were a course.

# Go!

And the third thing to consult while learning Kotlin and far far into writing Kotlin fluently is of course the [Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/). It's fortunately well structured and well written. The perfect source for quick look ups of how to use the native functionality of Kotlin. I have seen now that there are plenty of resources on that page for learning Kotlin as well with information around courses, IDEs, etc etc.

# RUN!

Shortly thereafter. Practically while writing this, I stumbled on [this page about idiomatic Kotlin](https://phauer.com/2017/idiomatic-kotlin-best-practices/).

This page is a real treasure. It's a list of comparisons tween how you would write Java and what you do instead in Kotlin. All examples are super clear and show what the idiomatic way of doing things in Kotlin is.

# Conclusion

Learning a programming language comes easy to me and these sources were enough to get me into a comfortable position for writing code within a very short time. Of course this is different for people that have no programming experience at all or don't come from a Java-like language. But with the knowledge that all code goes through pull requests with the developers, it's possible to start relatively fast and learn more along the way.
